    LineEdit is a subclass of QLineEdit that provides an easy and simple
    way to add widgets on the left or right hand side of the text.

    The layout of the widgets on either side are handled by a QHBoxLayout.
    You can set the spacing around the widgets with setWidgetSpacing().

    As widgets are added to the class they are inserted from the outside
    into the center of the widget.
