0.6.1
When using Arora with Qt 4.5.1 after a little while pages will stop rendering.
This is because of a bug in 4.5.1 where renaming a file will cause the file
descriptor to not be closed.  QNetworkDiskCache is a simple cache and uses
QTemporaryFile's for each new cached file and eventually the kernel
wont let QNetworkDiskCache open a cache file because all of the previous files were not
closed.  When running against Qt 4.5.1 Arora will now disable the disk cache.
