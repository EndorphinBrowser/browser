0.10.1
The major issues:
    Issue: 666 Sites were showing a "SSL handshake failure". With the new NetworkAccessManagerProxy the signals were being sent to the proxy and not the primary networkaccessmanager.
    Issue: 683: Arora crashes when using privacy mode.
	When switching to private mode the primary networkaccessmanagers swaps cookiejar's which caused a segfault. Introduce a CookieJarProxy class which will pass the cookie requests to the primary networkaccessmanager's cookiejar.

Translations:
    Add Portuguese translation from Américo Monteiro <a_monteiro@netcabo.pt>

    Issue: 472 Set the url on the location bar that matches the webview that we are loading the url in, not in the current location bar which might not be the correct one.
    Issue: 637 Startup Crash with Qt 4.5.0 (not with any other version)
    Issue: 679 Selecting Show only one close button instead of one for each tab requires an application restart to be applied.
    Issue: 676 Fix openstreetmap.org's login saving and improve the Wallet password dialog when finding the login name.
	Rather than using the document.form[0].name use document.form[0].elements["name"] this allows the name to contain things such as []'s without causing a problem.

0.6.1
When using Arora with Qt 4.5.1 after a little while pages will stop rendering.
This is because of a bug in 4.5.1 where renaming a file will cause the file
descriptor to not be closed.  QNetworkDiskCache is a simple cache and uses
QTemporaryFile's for each new cached file and eventually the kernel
wont let QNetworkDiskCache open a cache file because all of the previous files were not
closed.  When running against Qt 4.5.1 Arora will now disable the disk cache.
