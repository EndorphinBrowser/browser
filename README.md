# Endorphin web browser

Endorphin is a cross platform web browser built using Qt and WebKit.

This is a fork of the [Arora browser](https://github.com/Arora/arora).
This fork was created by Aaron Dewes with the goal of contnuing the development of this old browser and further improving it.

If you want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a PR.

### Building
Endorphin uses the cmake build system.  If you already have Qt 5.15 or newer on your system building is as easy as running the command 'cmake' and then 'make'.
